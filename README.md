** In this project i have emulated all data structures which are used my operating system to manage file system oriented tasks.

** As the name suggest it is "VIRTUAL" because i have maintained all the records in primary storage (RAM).

** In this project i have created all Data Structures Which Required For File Subsystems As : FT, UAREA, UFDT, SB, DILB, DB etc.

** I have provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of file subsystem As : Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.

** While creating this project,I have used and refred unix operating system.

* By using this project we can get overview of Unix operating system on any plateform.
